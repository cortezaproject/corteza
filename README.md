<br />

**Corteza server** is the **back-end** of the Corteza ecosystem.
The core logic is written in GO, using [go-chi](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/go-chi/chi@v3.3.4+incompatible?utm_source=gopls) for the routing.
External communication occurs via the **REST API and web sockets**; internal communication happens via gRPC.

Non-binary data is handled by the store layer and stored inside a database; currently **MySQL and PostgreSQL**.
We will add support for additional databases in the future.
Binary data is handled locally or on a supported cloud provider using [MinIO](https://min.io/).
