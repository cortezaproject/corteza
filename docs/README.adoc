# Corteza API documentation

WARNING: Work in progress

WARNING: Any changes to these files here require `make docs`

This is the first step in migration towards full OpenAPI standards support.`

## Original/starting state (pre `2020.9`; deprecated):
Home-brew API definition format in JSON, still available under `api/*/spec.json`.
This is still needed for controller/request/handler codegens. Documentation generators are disabled.

## Current state (`2020.9`)
In branch `2020.12.x` we're experimenting with first step toward conversion to OpenAPI 3.0 YAML files for API
definition. There is a converter available in https://github.com/cortezaproject/openapi3-converter[cortezaproject/openapi3-converter]
that takes those custom YAML files and converts them to OpenAPI format.

## Goal (target `2020.12`)
Generate HTTP handlers and all auxiliary code and documentation from YAML files in OpenAPI 3.0 format
