  title: Provisioning
  intro: |-
    Provisioning allows you to configure a {PRODUCT_NAME} instance when deployed.
    It occurs automatically after the {PRODUCT_NAME} server starts.

    [IMPORTANT]
    ====
    We recommend you to keep provisioning enabled as it simplifies version updates by updating the database and updating settings.

    If you're doing local development or some debugging, you can disable this.
