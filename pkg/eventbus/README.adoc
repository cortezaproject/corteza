# pkg/eventbus

Package handles event dispatching and trigger registration

## Event

Event (in context of eventbus package) contains of resource type, event type and a matcher.

### Resource type

Resource types are identifiers of internal resources, like user, role, request, ...

### Event type

Type describes direct or indirect user action or some other event in the system.

#### Deferred events

Deferred events (onTimestamp and onInterval) are executed by scheduler package service.

#### Manual events

Manual events (onManual) are a special case.
Events are not (nor should be) triggered directly or through eventbus.

We use it to route requests and pack attributes from the API to the Corredor service

### Event matcher

Matcher is a function on event that helps filtering fired events.
It decides (returns true or false) if fired event is a match for any of a registered triggers

Bus has basic internal filtering for resource & event type.
Other constraints are passed to event's matcher function.

.Matcher will receive 2+ string parameters:
 - name
 - operator
 - zero or more values

It's matcher responsibility to handle contents of name, operator and values parameters.

Constraint checker procedure will call matcher for each constraint.
All constraints must match.
First non-match will break constraint checking procedure.


## Triggers

Trigger is combination of (event matching) rules/constraints and event handler.
Handler is a callback function called when a compatible event is fired.

Trigger can respond to multiple resource/event combinations.

### Constraints

Matcher function is called multiple times, once per each trigger constraint.
If any of the calls result in a non-match, check

Trigger without constraint is considered a match.

### Weight

Weight controls order of trigger execution.
