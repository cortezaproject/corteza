# Options YAML integration

This file is meant to help with the creation of a .YAML file inside options package.

The name of the .YAML will dedicate the name of the .gen.go file e.g. fileName1.yaml -> fileName1.gen.go, filename2.yaml -> filename2.gen.go

The contents of the .YAML file should look like this:

   name: ...

   imports: 
      - ...

   props
      - name: ...
        type: ...
        env: ...
        default: ...
      


**name**
   - It is the name of the struct

**imports** 
   - The list of imports that are needed, if there are no imporsts you may skip this step

**props**
   - props: - *name* -> name of variable
   - props: - *type* -> the type of variable if not given it is "string" by default
   - props: - *env* -> environment value that if it is not defined will be auto generated from "name" and "props: - name"
   - props: - *default* -> the default value that is asigned to the "prop" strings should be given in double quotations if they are to be qouted
