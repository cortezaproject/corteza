# Options YAML integration

This file is meant to help with the creation of a .YAML file inside options package.

The name of the *.YAML* will dedicate the name of the *.gen.go* file e.g. fileName1.yaml -> fileName1.gen.go, filename2.yaml -> filename2.gen.go

The contents of the *.YAML* file should look like this:

   name: ...

   imports: 
      - ...

   props
      - name: ...
        type: ...
        env: ...
        default: ...
        description: ...
