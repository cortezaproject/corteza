# How to Contribute

Corteza projects are [Apache 2.0 licensed](LICENSE) and accept contributions via
GitHub pull requests.  This document outlines some of the conventions on
development workflow, commit message formatting, contact points and other
resources to make it easier to get your contribution accepted.

# Certificate of Origin

By contributing to this project you agree to the Developer Certificate of
Origin (DCO). This document was created by the Linux Kernel community and is a
simple statement that you, as a contributor, have the legal right to make the
contribution. See the [DCO](DCO) file for details.

# Getting Started

- Fork the repository on GitHub
- Read the [Wiki](https://github.com/cortezaproject/corteza-server/wiki) for build and test instructions
- Play with the project, submit bugs, submit patches!

## Contribution Flow

This is a rough outline of what a contributor's workflow looks like:

- Create a topic branch from where you want to base your work (usually master).
- Make commits of logical units.
- Make sure your commit messages are in the proper format (see below).
- Push your changes to a topic branch in your fork of the repository.
- Make sure the tests pass, and add any new tests as appropriate.
- Submit a pull request to the original repository.

Thanks for your contributions!

### Format of the Commit Message

See [How to Write a Git Commit Message](https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/).

Summary of the article and the seven rules of a great Git commit message

 1. Separate subject from body with a blank line
 2. Limit the subject line to 50 characters
 3. Capitalize the subject line
 4. Do not end the subject line with a period
 5. Use the imperative mood in the subject line
 6. Wrap the body at 72 characters
 7. Use the body to explain what and why vs. how

We are not terribly strict against a particular commit message format, but
the general rule is to avoid non-descriptive single-word commit messages like "fix".

We might ask you to rewrite/rebase your commit messages if they land too far from the
rules above.
