# Corteza Server Web Console

## Setting up

When developing web-console backend (API) base URL must be set to the actual server. That can be achieved by setting a URL as value local store item with `console-api-base-url` as key:

```javascript
localStorage.setItem('console-api-base-url', '//localhost:3000/console')
```  

Make sure console and all required routes are enabled on the server (`ENVIRONMENT=dev` and/or `HTTP_WEB_CONSOLE_ENABLED=true`). 
Also make sure username and password is disabled for the console for development.

## Type Support for `.vue` Imports in TS

TypeScript cannot handle type information for `.vue` imports by default, so we replace the `tsc` CLI with `vue-tsc` for type checking. In editors, we need [TypeScript Vue Plugin (Volar)](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=johnsoncodehk.vscode-typescript-vue-plugin) to make the TypeScript language service aware of `.vue` types.

If the standalone TypeScript plugin doesn't feel fast enough to you, Volar has also implemented a [Take Over Mode](https://github.com/johnsoncodehk/volar/discussions/471#discussioncomment-1361669) that is more performant. You can enable it by the following steps:

1. Disable the built-in TypeScript Extension
    1) Run `Extensions: Show Built-in Extensions` from VSCode's command palette
    2) Find `TypeScript and JavaScript Language Features`, right click and select `Disable (Workspace)`
2. Reload the VSCode window by running `Developer: Reload Window` from the command palette.
