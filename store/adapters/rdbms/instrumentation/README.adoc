= RDBMS Store instrumentation & debug

This package provides wrap around `database/sql/driver` that logs and measures db activities that pass through store.

== Current capabilities

=== Debug wrapper

Logging of all activities (connections, queries, execs, transactions) and activity duration measures.
This feature should be used in development env and disabled in production.

.To enable debugging, use extra * parameter for DSN:
====
DB_DSN="postgres+debug://crust:crust@localhost:5432/crust?sslmode=disable&"
====

In previous versions similar functionality was enabled by setting `DB_LOGGER` environmental variable.
This is no longer supported because of migration to "store" architecture and ability to selectively enable this
only for specific connections.

== Plans

This package will support proper instrumentation, tracing and metrics via OpenTracing/OpenTelemetry.
