Changes
=======

v1.0.5
[New features]
  * `(strftime.Strftime).FormatBuffer([]byte, time.Time) []byte` has been added.
    This allows the user to provide the same underlying `[]byte` buffer for each
    call to `FormatBuffer`, which avoid allocation per call. 
  * `%I` formatted midnight as `00`, where it should have been using `01`


before v1.0.4

Apparently we have failed to provide Changes prior to v1.0.5 :(
