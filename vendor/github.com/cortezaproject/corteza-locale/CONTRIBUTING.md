# Contributing

Thank you for helping us make [our vision](https://cortezaproject.org/about/what-is-corteza/) a reality!
All contributions are welcome; from bug reports, codefixes, and new features!

## Ground Rules

Corteza projects are [Apache 2.0 licensed](LICENSE) and accept contributions via GitHub pull requests.

Cover the [terminology](https://docs.cortezaproject.org/corteza-docs/2022.3/developer-guide/release-cycle/index.html#_terminology) for the development process and versioning.

Cover the [Git and GitHub](https://docs.cortezaproject.org/corteza-docs/2022.3/developer-guide/release-cycle/index.html#_github) ground rules regarding branch naming and conventions.

When you wish to start working on a code contribution, assign yourself to a GitHub issue.
If there is no issue, create one beforehand.

A quick summary on [How to Write a Git Commit Message](https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/):

1. Separate subject from body with a blank line
2. Limit the subject line to 50 characters
3. Capitalize the subject line
4. Do not end the subject line with a period
5. Use the imperative mood in the subject line
6. Wrap the body at 72 characters
7. Use the body to explain what and why vs. how

## Core repositories

### Corteza Server

Corteza server is the back-end of the Corteza ecosystem.
The core logic is written in GO, using [go-chi](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/go-chi/chi@v3.3.4+incompatible?utm_source=gopls) for the routing.

Communication between the Corteza server and web applications is done using the REST API and web sockets.
Communication between back-end services (Corteza server and Corredor) is done using gRPC.

The [Developer Guide/Corteza Server](https://docs.cortezaproject.org/corteza-docs/2022.3/developer-guide/corteza-server/index.html) covers the [development setup](https://docs.cortezaproject.org/corteza-docs/2022.3/developer-guide/corteza-server/index.html#_development_setup), the [project structure](https://docs.cortezaproject.org/corteza-docs/2022.3/developer-guide/corteza-server/structure.html), and the feature insight documents.
